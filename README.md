# odin-recipes

Usage:
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished, unless you’re into brutalist web design, that is. 

Open the website using index.html in browser.

Aim:
To build a website using basic HTML which will showcase some knowledge.

Installation notes:
Does not require installation, just open index.html.

Credits:
The project will be created using guidance via The Odin Project which you can find a link to here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#introduction
